# Crypto-Hub
The aim of this summer project is to develop a centralised place to track and manage any cryptocurrency portfolio automatically, without having to manually add any trades, API's from decentralised exchanges and wallets will allow for evey trade to be logged in one place. Should provide valuable experience with coding using the Flask framework, Javascript and other web languages, and coding in a team environment.
